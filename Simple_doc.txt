run vcpkg integrate install, after installation, so you can use the libraries it installed directly in visual studio, rather than doing other further setups.
install libraries using vcpkg (which is a package manager maintained by microsoft for getting libries and setting up for you for c++ projects. So you don't have to go through the hassles and setting it up yourself).
