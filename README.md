# Dynasty_manga_coordinator
A utility tool for coordinating with the yuri manga website
Built with Casablanca sdk for providing the https networking functionalities, and c++20. It aims to pay tribute to the yuri manga website that we all like and enjoy. All codes are free software, I hope the MIT licsence is enough for it. I am going to maintian this repo and add functionalities to the program.

Currently it can do something as :
Having a user configuration json file.
Using a subscription file (which you put the url of the series) to automatically update all the newest manga to your local drive (it's against the website's json api with the cached version)

Enjoy using it. Contributions to this project are welcomed. Because I wrote this program and I am maintaining this repo, please understand and follow the programming style I am doing, I am using a lot c++20 features as well and I don't want you to break my codes, but feel free to fork it to write everything your own, that's the nature of git.
